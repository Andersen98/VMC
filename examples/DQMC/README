# To generate integrals and other input files:
python $system_name.py > pyscf.out

# To generate determinants using Dice, if using multi-Slater trial:
mpirun -np 8 $Dice_binary dice.dat > dice.out

# To run afqmc/dqmc
mpirun -np 8 $DQMC_binary afqmc.json > afqmc.out

# To do autocorrelation and error analysis for afqmc
python $VMC_ROOT/scritps/blocking.py samples.dat 50 > blocking.out

# NB: samples.dat is written to disk by DQMC and has weights and energies as columns, 50 (or a number of your chosing) is the number of equilibration samples, which can be determined by plotting the second column of samples.dat
